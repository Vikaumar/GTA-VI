## ✅ Accessibility & Performance Tips

* Add meaningful `alt` text for all images.
* Optimize hero/background images (WebP or compressed JPEG) to reduce load times.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for users who prefer less animation.
* Use `loading="lazy"` for offscreen images.
* Consider a CDN for static assets if traffic grows.
