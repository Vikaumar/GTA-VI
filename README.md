# 🚗 GTA-Style Fan Website — GTA-VI

A fun, **GTA-inspired** single-page website built with **React + Vite** for practice and portfolio. This project is a fan-made tribute and learning exercise — not an official Rockstar Games product.

**Live demo:** [https://vikaumar.github.io/GTA-VI/](https://vikaumar.github.io/GTA-VI/)

## ✅ Accessibility & Performance Tips

* Add meaningful `alt` text for all images.
* Optimize hero/background images (WebP or compressed JPEG) to reduce load times.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for users who prefer less animation.
* Use `loading="lazy"` for offscreen images.
* Consider a CDN for static assets if traffic grows.
